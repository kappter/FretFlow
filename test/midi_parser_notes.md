# MIDI Parser JS Usage Notes

## Key Findings from Documentation

The library accepts:
1. **Base64 encoded string** - for Node.js file reading
2. **Uint8Array** - from ArrayBuffer
3. **FileInput Element** - for browser file selection

## Correct Usage

According to the docs:
```js
// For base64:
var midiArray = midiParser.parse(base64String);

// For Uint8Array:
var midiArray = midiParser.parse(uint8Array);

// For FileInput:
MidiParser.parse(fileInputElement, callback);
```

## Issue Found

The library is returning `false` when parsing fails. The documentation shows it should return an object with `track`, `formatType`, `timeDivision`, etc.

The test showed "Header validation failed" - this suggests the library is checking for proper MIDI headers but something is wrong with how we're passing the data.

## Solution

Looking at the examples, the library should accept Uint8Array directly. Our current implementation is correct, but we need to verify the library is loaded properly and check if there's a version issue with the CDN.
